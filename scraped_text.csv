Carlton Hotel Tunis,Tunis,Great stay in Tunis,Stayed 5 nights at the Carlton this Dec and totally loved my stay. The hotel is in a terrific location, very close to the Medina and right in the high street. The rooms were nice and clean, and the breakfast had a lot of variety. The front desk staff weren't as friendly as one would expect, but that shouldn't be a big deal. Overall a great stay and good value for money.Carlton Hotel Tunis,Tunis,A comfortable boutique hotel,I book this hotel purely because of the recommendation of a blogger, convenient in city heart. No expectation, but finally it’s surprisingly good. Bright, modern design, and the room is clean.  The breakfast is good too, The most important point that the price is very reasonable. If I come again Tunis, I’ll properly book again.Carlton Hotel Tunis,Tunis,4 days in tunis,The hotel is recently reniewed. It is central, clean; bed is very comfy and bathroom too. The service is kind. I had noisy neighbours but this is not the hotel's fault. Very good value for money, i would definitely choose it again.Carlton Hotel Tunis,Tunis,Great Value and Breakfast ,Although the rooms are in need of a renovation, the hotel offers great value and a super location. The breakfast is amazing, the entire place is smoke free and the front desk staff helpful. Only main drawback, no English channels on TV. Carlton Hotel Tunis,Tunis,Nice stay,Clean and nice room. Good breakfast with a lot of options. The staff is  frieandly and help full. Great location, close with walking distance to a lot of places. Can really recomened it. Also afforable price.Hotel Belvedere Fourati,Tunis,Excellent Service and Accommodations for a Student Group,Hotel Belvedere Fourati was wonderfully accommodating and hospitable for our group of students. They really went above and beyond in making us feel at home and never failed to impress with their consistent professionalism.Hotel Belvedere Fourati,Tunis,Our Student Group had a Wonderful Experience,The hotel gave us a high level of personal service.  We had several group dinners at the hotel, some with academic speakers, and the the food and service were excellent.  Rooms were very good, and the students were pleased.  The most important thing is the service, which is attentive, kind and goes the extra mile.  They even prepared a special dessert for our final meal in Tunisia.  This is our second trip to Tunisia with students, both times at the Belevedere.  It is excellent.Hotel Belvedere Fourati,Tunis,Feel like a queen,Small but so very clean rooms.  Everyone went the extra mile to help with anything and everything.  Every time I pass the door, I feel like I am home.  Since all restaurants are closed in Tunis on Sunday, the only choice left is the hotel dining room; good food, good price and good service.  The terasse offers beautiful sunsets over the city.  Nice 30 minute walk to Avenue Habib Bourguiba and the medina.  One block from the park.  Good restaurants within a 3 minute walk or less.Hotel Belvedere Fourati,Tunis,My best choice in Tunis,I always try to book at belvédère when in Tunis for business. Service is top class and kindness and professionalism of staff make perfect my staying in Tunis. My first choice in Tunis. Highly recommendedHotel Belvedere Fourati,Tunis,Hotel Stay,I stayed there for 10 days and the staff was great and super friendly. The room was good. I will definitely come back here again. I do recommend this place for anyone coming to Tunis. You won’t regret staying hereDAR EL JELD Hotel & Spa,Tunis,The place to enjoy if you choose to stay in their Kasbah...,While we didn’t stay here, we ended up really enjoying it, so we would walk from our hotel, the other 5 Star down near the Souk, and simply hang out.  Here is the thing about this place. The. Hotel was renovated years ago, probably by a corporation.  They didn’t run out of money which is I think what happened to the renovation on the place we stayed at.  Meaning, there was heat in all the rooms; LED lighting architected very professionally; all the staff were either in handsome clean uniforms or they had the style to dress accordingly.  Biggest other izzue, they all had a good command of the English language, which meant a lot for us, we don’t speak French, nor Arabic.  It izn’t too difficult to find, it’s in a safe enough part of the Old Town, and their prices are in line withDAR EL JELD Hotel & Spa,Tunis,Amazing stay!,Excellent new and large suites in an amazing property; perfectly located in the Medina with a great rooftop restaurant; outstanding service and exceptionally friendly staff (late check out was made possible); 100% worth the price which is very modest by North American standardsDAR EL JELD Hotel & Spa,Tunis,The jewel of Tunis,The Medina, as soon as you enter this hotel you will be struck by the beauty, simplicity and elegance of the building. The suite is really welcoming and very spacious; refined in every detail. The staff is very kind and ready to help you in all circumstances. A hotel to suggest to anyone who loves to live in a comfortable and tasteful place.DAR EL JELD Hotel & Spa,Tunis,Superb,A fantastic 5 star boutique hotel in the Medina in Tunis.   Truly fabulous from the moment you step through the wonderful yellow door. It is like stepping into another world.  It is built in a very traditional style, though with all mod cons.   The suite we stayed in was magnificent. It felt like a perfect luxury home from home flat, with an incredibly comfortable superking bed.   Breakfast was very yummy, and the service impeccable. We ate in the rooftop restaurant. Also excellent.   I have stayed in a few 5 star hotels. I think this is the best I have stayed in. DAR EL JELD Hotel & Spa,Tunis,Excellent,Large, new and fully equipped room, reasonable price, location right at the entrance of the medina, service very attentive, breakfast excellent.   Only negative: Curtains are not full black out.   Tip: In Tunis get taxis on the street or via the website etaxi. If you book one via a hotel, it will cost 5 times more.   Dar Ben-Gacem,Tunis,Cannot give this place enough stars,Am recently back from a short break over New Year at Dar Ben Gacem. It was simply great in every way but predominantly the beautiful home itself and the equally lovely staff running it. The building itself has been lovingly and elegantly restored. My room ("Tej") had a gorgeous raised bed with a seating area beneath. I loved the tiles in the bathroom. There are multiple areas throughout the building to relax, whether it's the courtyard, library, or indoor and outdoor spaces on the roof, which have nice views across the local roof tops.  Many places can look beautiful but what really makes a place special is the staff who run it. All of the young men thar were working there during my stay were friendly, kind, and always willing to help. There are no tea or coffee makingDar Ben-Gacem,Tunis,Good service,Finding the hotel without a guide or driver would be tricky, as the place is tucked in Tunis Medina.  The hotel is an old home with rooms facing an internal courtyard. While this is safe and protected from the street, it can amplify noise if like me you go to bed early.  The Medina neighbourhood is old and interesting, and you can observe the daily life of residents. However, it is not clean and we did not feel safe walking home from dinners at night. Also, there are very few food and beverage options outside the odd grocery store.  Our room still had beautiful 18th century features and a high ceiling, however the bathroom was small and pokey, and we had trouble with hot water on the first day.  What distinguishes the hotel is it’s service. We found the staff very obliging, toDar Ben-Gacem,Tunis,Wonderful stay,Absolutely wonderful stay. Beautiful property with a very modern, yet authentic take on Tunisian decor. The staff were excellent and very attentive.   Just fyi, there are two Dar Ben Gacem (sister properties). DBG Kahia is the one with all of the white and slightly minimalist. The other is with the more traditional decor. Both are about a 3 minute's walk from each other.Dar Ben-Gacem,Tunis,Visit with two small kids ,We stayed at the newly opened second Dar Ben Gacem boutique hotel al Kahia. I was with my two small kids ( 7 and 4). What can I say... MESMERIZING! What a beautiful place. The level of detail in the art selection is impressive. The staff is wonderful. I am in awe of this place and will definitely be back. Highly recommend.Dar Ben-Gacem,Tunis,Authentic, perfectly located, and caringly run,We adored this place.  Some might not.  To place yourself, consider:  Your room is a little hot when you return from dinner.  While you wait for the cooling unit to do its job, you decide to check out the roof terrace.  You climb the slightly too-steep stairs, choose a slightly shaky metal chair, and look out over the Medina rooftops to the ancient mosque a thousand feet away.  Exotic sounds and smells rise all around you.  As you watch a lizard skitter around your feet, the call to prayer breaks out all around, from minaret to minaret.  If this sounds like your idea of a lovely evening, this is the place for you.  If the steep stairs and rickety chair and lizard bother you, pick a western-style hotel outside the Medina.  But most Tripadvisor clients, I expect, will love thisLe Corail Suites Hotel,Tunis,Perfect stay,I recommend this hotel for a business trip as well as for a family trip. The hotel is located in a very nice area, with shops and a quite big mall. The brakfast was very good with high quality food. We enjoyed there very much!Le Corail Suites Hotel,Tunis,Best Service & Very helpful staff,I had stayed in the hotel for a few days and it was very accommodating and the staff is always helpful and services were excellent, For sure next time in Tunisia will stay in it again & I Highly recommend itLe Corail Suites Hotel,Tunis,Good hotel with very kind staff ,I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights.. Hotel is so clean and staff is so helpful..  The receptionist was so helpful with good attitude..  The only thing is missing is the gym.. They have small room equipped with treadmill only..   Overall I'm so satisfied. Le Corail Suites Hotel,Tunis,Average hotel at comparatively higher rates,I stayed in this hotel for 2 months totally  1 month each time. So I feel I am quite eligible to write this review. First of all this is like any other luxurious business hotel at least in terms of rent they charge. So the expectations are different in terms of service because you spend much of your day time outside the hotel. But the treatment or service given during check in, stay or check out is up to the mark at all. Every time I had to wait for some time to get checked in/ check out. My last check out procedure lasted for more than 20 minutes even though I had informed them in advance about the check out. I had remind them of my flight time repeatedly to make it faster.   Daily services they offer are not consistent - some days they will give you complimentary water andLe Corail Suites Hotel,Tunis,Clean hotel nice stuff and Mr. Mehdi the manager was respectful,The hotel was very clean my room was big with a big kitchen and a spacious salon.  The breakfast was nice and the stuff were very kind.   The hotel position is near the Tunisian mall and restaurants.   Mehdi the general manager was respectful. La Chambre bleue,Tunis,Great b&b,We were fortunate that when we contacted Sondos that she had the Makhazen room (with the cross-vault soaring ceilings and a column) available.  The room has a private courtyard and is very spacious.  The bathroom is quirky (no door) but functional.  The walk-in shower is a small alcove but as there is no shower door or screen it does not feel cramped (nor did the bathroom get wet!).  Breakfast is served upstairs in the dining room.  There were significant changes every day but constant were an outstanding juice (prune, peach and banana), yoghurt, black bread toast, ricotta and a large array of jams and honey plus coffee/tea.  The girl service breakfast and making our room was so delightful!  Breakfast was served from 08:30 and we never had any appetite for lunch afterwards! La Chambre bleue,Tunis,Loved it! ,It was a very nice hotel. Beautiful design and interior. I really liked the atmosphere and the service was great! If I go to Tunisia next time, this hotel will be my destination for sure. Thank you so much for a great opportunity! La Chambre bleue,Tunis,The Best Place to Stay in Tunis, on ANY Budget!,La Chambre bleue is an absolutely wonderful bed and breakfast in the heart of the Medina of Tunis. Sondos, the gracious Hostess, makes you feel right at home in every way possible. She really goes the extra mile. Incredibly friendly, patient, and multilingual, she will give you one of the best breakfasts is you'll have in your life!  Does anyone else love home made jam?    Not only that, but she will also give you an infinite amount of recommendations for Tunis as well as the rest of Tunisia. I actually had many questions for her during the day while out.  So, via WhatsApp, I asked her about many things many times. She always got back to me incredibly quickly!  Even after we had checked out, her response time was super quick whenever we had a question for her.    Also, the roomLa Chambre bleue,Tunis,A good stay overall ,After reading all the positive TripAdvisor reviews, I decided to stay at La Chambre Bleue located in the Tunis Medina. My expectations were high and overall, the place did not disappoint.   After reading all the positive reviews , one might expect the place to blow your mind and knock your senses off completely - i.e create expectations of complete perfection.   My advice is to keep your expectations realistic when visiting this place and staying at La Chambre bleue. All in all , I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Tunis - La Chambre Bleue certainly did not disappoint but it was not spectacular either, as some other reviews may suggest. Hence , I am keeping this review as realistic and factual as possible.  The location of La Chambre bleue is spectacular - it is in the heart of theLa Chambre bleue,Tunis,Great stay!,I really enjoyed my experience in this intimate guest house, located in the heart of the Medina of Tunis.  The owner and host is a charming woman who was exceptionally helpful, served a delicious, home-cooked breakfast and stayed for excellent conversation. The place was clean, comfortable, and the internet service worked very well.  I hope to return!Africa Hotel,Tunis,Not 5 star hotel!!!,The room not 29 sq  its smaller maybe 23 sq ,The room old and there is stain and dirty in the room. The shower very very very old and the water unclean unclear water , the door of the room you need to push strong to open and close ,,, they say there is renovations in the hotel idonot see any one work in the hotel when there is renovation you listen they the voice when they work. The air conditioning turn to heater and the weather outside is 17c. Its not cool to turn the air conditioning to heater , forgot the wifi there no wifi and if connecte to wifi and you want to open youtube you cannot its its its very weak. The only best thing is the location, otherwise there is nothing!Africa Hotel,Tunis,Tunisia stay - Hotel Africa - El Mouradi Africa ,Joined a group tour to Tunisia, stayed at the above hotel,  great location with convenience store just a few steps from the hotel.  Hotel is closed by to restaurants and cafes and Medina (old city) is within 20 mins walk on foot.  Dinner was buffet spread,  mainly Tunisian cuisine. Breakfast was American buffet spread.  Basic room amenities however no tissue paper provided other than that it was ok for accommodation which one would expect from a 4 star hotel. Africa Hotel,Tunis,Bed Bugs,This place is filthy. There is no pride in how this place is taken care of or operated service wise. Pictures I posted tell it all. Carpets filthy in rooms, dining, chairs filthy, table cloths not laundered and yes that's a bed bug and that's one of the bites I received. I called front desk said they would send someone up - no-one showed up. I checked out and showed them the pictures two hours after I discovered the bed bug and they told me I should call my tour operator. I left the do not disturb sign on my door while heading out for lunch - they came in my room, installed a new TV, and cleaned the room with the sign on. They call themselves a 5* that's a joke. People posted here two months ago about 2/3 elevators working - still the case last week. Do yourself a favour andAfrica Hotel,Tunis,Rooms fine, staff bored,I will repeat what others have said, it is a great centrally located situation.  The rooms are tired but comfortable.  No free water in the room but there is a fridge and the water is not more expensive than at the airport.  Some staff were great like the guy who gave me directions to the train station at 5:00 a.m.  Others seemed like they were phoning it in.  While I did get an on-line deal, that is no reason to treat people (who may eventually come back at a higher rate) dismissively.  I highly recommend the lubia at the Cairo restaurant on Cairo street.  There is a whole area of restaurants there selling Sfaxian cuisine.  I'm forced to choose from 2-3 hotels in Tunis but otherwise I wouldn't return.  Africa Hotel,Tunis,Faded elegance in need of some repairs,I stayed as part of a tour and had three different rooms. I did not select this hotel. Great location near Medina and main boulevard but beware it can get noisy at night if that is a concern. Great though for restaurant choices and cafes. Money exchange nearby as well as pharmacy across the road. The beds are large but mattresses are average. Shower and bathroom are good but mind toilet seat may be loose.  Major issues: Phones in all three rooms I stayed in never worked. Electricity went out throughout the night in one room. There are only three tiny elevators for a 20 story building. One was out of service the entire stay. Stairwells are poorly marked and no one uses them except for first few floors. As a woman traveling I had an unrequested repairman show up the first stay.
